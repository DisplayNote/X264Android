# run_docs_agent.sh — run the headless docs-maintenance agent over the scope,
# edit documentation only, and stage the result. Roadmap 2.30.
#
# Engine is pluggable (ENGINE env): "copilot" (default) or "claude".
#   copilot : GitHub Copilot CLI in programmatic mode (`copilot -p`). Billed to
#             your existing Copilot seats — no separate model key. Auth via
#             COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN (a fine-grained PAT with Copilot access).
#   claude  : Claude Code headless (`claude -p`). Auth via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   ENGINE              - copilot | claude   (default copilot)
#   MAINTENANCE_PROMPT  - default docs/ai/prompts/docs-maintenance.md
#   SCOPE_FILE          - default docs-scope.txt (one path per line;
#                         empty/absent => full drift sweep / catch-up)
#   MODEL               - optional model override (engine-specific)
#   MAX_TURNS           - claude only; default 60 (agent-loop / cost guardrail)
#   COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN- copilot engine auth
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   - claude engine auth
#
# Output (consumed by the PR/branch step which commits/pushes/comments):
#   - stages only doc files (AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md doc docs Docs .docs-sync.json)
#   - writes docs-agent.log (full agent transcript)
# Host-agnostic: works under GitHub Actions or a plain shell.
