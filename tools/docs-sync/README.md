# docs-sync — keep documentation in sync, nightly (roadmap 2.30)

Once a night, and only when code actually changed, a GitHub Actions workflow
runs the in-repo `docs-maintenance` prompt through an AI agent over the code
committed to `master` since the last documented point, makes the surgical doc
edits, and **opens one documentation PR** against `master`.

This is the maintenance half of the documentation lifecycle: 1.19 *created* the
docs; 2.30 *keeps them in sync* automatically. It edits documentation only and
never blocks anything.

## Two workflows

- **`docs-sync.yml`** — **nightly** (03:00 UTC) + `workflow_dispatch`. Scoped to
  the code committed to `master` since the last documented commit; opens one
  `chore/docs-nightly-*` PR. This is the ongoing mechanism. It runs at most once
  a day, does nothing when no code changed, and pauses while a docs PR is open.
- **`docs-catchup.yml`** — a FULL drift sweep, on demand (`workflow_dispatch`)
  and weekly (Mondays 05:00 UTC). It opens one `chore/docs-catchup-*` PR. Use
  the on-demand run once per repo to reconcile the drift that built up *before*
  this existed; the weekly run is the safety net for silent drift a scoped diff
  can't see (behaviour changed, file barely moved).

### Why nightly and not per-PR

Earlier revisions ran on every `pull_request` push and committed docs into the
PR branch. One agent run per push per open PR is the dominant cost of this pack
and it re-reviewed the same docs repeatedly. Nightly caps it at one run per day
per repo. The trade-off: docs land in a **follow-up** PR rather than inside the
code PR that caused them, so a merged code PR is briefly undocumented. Review
the nightly PR promptly — the sync pauses while one is open.

## Engine — Copilot by default

The agent runs via the **GitHub Copilot CLI** in programmatic mode
(`copilot -p`), billed to your org's Copilot subscription.

**Auth requires a user PAT.** The Copilot CLI authenticates against the model
endpoint with a **user token that has Copilot access**. The Actions built-in
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is a GitHub App (server-to-server) token and is **rejected**
("GitHub App Server-To-Server Tokens are not supported for this endpoint"), so a
PAT is required: create repo secret **`COPILOT_PAT`** = a fine-grained PAT with
the **"Copilot Requests"** permission, owned by a user/service account that
holds a **Copilot seat**. It is passed as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` on the agent
step only (the model call) — never for pushing.

> The no-PAT, built-in-token path (`copilot-requests: write`) only works under
> **GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)**, not the standalone `copilot` CLI used
> here. If avoiding a PAT matters, port these workflows to gh-aw.

To use **Claude Code** instead, set `ENGINE=claude` in the workflow and provide
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (metered, pay-per-use; shares the 2.22 key). The rest of the
pack is identical — the engine is the only thing that changes.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/docs-sync.yml` *(repo root)* | nightly workflow: schedule, anchor + scope, agent, PR |
| `.github/workflows/docs-catchup.yml` *(repo root)* | full-sweep workflow: on-demand backfill + weekly safety net |
| `tools/docs-sync/run_docs_agent.sh` | assembles the prompt + scope and runs the agent (Copilot or Claude) |
| `tools/docs-sync/open_catchup_pr.sh` | opens the documentation PR — `MODE=nightly` or `MODE=catchup` (default) |
| `tools/docs-sync/docs_freshness.py` | coverage + freshness metric (zero deps; the 2.30 gate) |
| `docs/ai/prompts/docs-maintenance.md` *(repo root)* | the drift-aware prompt the agent runs |
| `.docs-sync.json` *(repo root)* | per-repo manifest: module → doc → code paths |

## How it runs

- Triggers on `schedule` (nightly 03:00 UTC) and `workflow_dispatch`. There is
  no `pull_request` trigger, so pushing to a PR never starts an agent run.
- **Resumes from the last documented commit, not from "24h ago".** Every doc
  commit this pack creates carries a `Docs-sync-anchor: <sha>` trailer recording
  the base-branch commit it was written against. The next run diffs
  `<anchor>..HEAD`. This matters: a night that fails, is skipped (no PAT), or
  whose PR sits unmerged does **not** lose those code changes, because the anchor
  only advances when a docs PR merges. An explicit sha (rather than the doc
  commit's parent) keeps it correct under squash and rebase merges too.
  - First run on a repo with no such commit in history: falls back to a **26h**
    window (26, not 24, so scheduler drift can't leave a gap between two nights).
  - `workflow_dispatch` accepts a `since` input (a git date expression such as
    `3 days ago`) to override the anchor for a one-off wider sweep.
- Doc paths (`Docs/**`, `doc/**`, `docs/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.docs-sync.json`) are filtered out of the scope, so the workflow never reacts
  to its own commits. **If no code changed, nothing else runs** — no agent, no
  PR, and the run stays green.
- **One docs PR at a time.** If a `chore/docs-*` PR is already open, the run
  skips before the (paid) agent step rather than stacking a second PR. Nothing is
  lost — the anchor hasn't advanced, so the next run re-proposes the full delta.
- If `COPILOT_PAT` isn't configured, the agent step is **skipped (not failed)** —
  the workflow emits a notice and stays green. Configure the secret (below) to
  actually run the agent.
- If the agent produces doc changes, they land on a fresh
  `chore/docs-nightly-<date>-<run>-<attempt>` branch and one PR is opened against
  `master`, labelled `docs-sync` + `ai-influenced`. Pushing with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  does **not** re-trigger workflows, so there is no loop.

## One-time setup (per repo)

1. **Secret `COPILOT_PAT` (required for Copilot).** A fine-grained PAT with the
   "Copilot Requests" permission, from a user/service account that holds a
   Copilot seat. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → `COPILOT_PAT`.
   The built-in token cannot be used for Copilot inference (see Engine above).
   *(For the Claude engine instead: add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and set `ENGINE: claude`.)*
2. **Workflow permissions.** Already enabled org-wide at DisplayNote (Settings →
   Actions → General → Workflow permissions = "Read and write"), so engineers
   don't need to touch this. The workflows also declare their own `permissions:`
   block. *(Only relevant if you fork this outside the org.)*
3. **Manifest.** Commit a `.docs-sync.json` at the repo root (see the example).
   Set `docs_root` per repo (`doc` for Montage, `Docs` for Launcher). The agent
   maintains the `modules` list from then on.
4. **Branch protection (recommended).** Require a human review on the PR and add
   a CODEOWNERS rule on the docs root (`doc/**` in this repo) so doc changes
   always get a set of eyes.
5. **Pin the Copilot CLI (recommended).** Both workflows install
   `@github/copilot@${{ vars.COPILOT_CLI_VERSION || 'latest' }}`. Set the repo
   variable `COPILOT_CLI_VERSION` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
   Variables) to a known-good version so CLI releases can't change flag/behaviour
   under you; bump it deliberately. Left unset, it tracks `latest`.
6. **Drop in the files** at the paths in the table above.
7. **Reconcile existing drift first.** Run `docs-catchup.yml` once via
   Actions → docs-catchup → "Run workflow" to open the backfill PR. Merging it
   plants the first `Docs-sync-anchor:` commit, which is what the nightly then
   resumes from. Verify the nightly with Actions → docs-sync → "Run workflow".

## Cost & guardrails (locked decisions)

- **Cost.** Copilot engine = flat cost on your existing seats (no metered key).
  At most **one agent run per repo per day**, scoped to the code changed since
  the last documented commit, and none at all on a quiet day or while a docs PR
  is open. *(Claude engine is metered; guarded by `--max-turns 60` and the sonnet
  model.)*
- **Docs-only.** The agent's tool allow-list (`write`, `shell(git:*)`,
  `shell(python:*)`) and the staging restriction to
  `AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md doc Docs .docs-sync.json` mean it cannot land
  production-code changes.
- **Always reviewed.** Commits land on a `chore/docs-*` branch behind a PR;
  nothing reaches a protected branch unreviewed.
- **Attribution.** Commit identity is the generic `docs-sync` bot; nothing
  mentions AI / co-authorship. Add the `ai-influenced` label via branch policy
  or a CODEOWNERS automation if you want these counted in 2.3.

## Measuring the 2.30 gate

`docs_freshness.py` runs anywhere — no API key, no network:

```bash
python tools/docs-sync/docs_freshness.py --manifest .docs-sync.json --mode report
```

- **Coverage** = documented modules / declared modules (target ≥ 80%).
- **Freshness** = no module whose newest code commit is more than
  `freshness_max_lag_days` (default 30) newer than its doc.
- `--mode report` always exits 0 (use while ramping up). Switch to
  `--mode gate` (e.g. as a separate scheduled job or a required status check)
  once coverage is stable to make staleness a hard signal.

Each workflow uploads a `docs-freshness-*.json` artifact
(`docs-freshness-nightly-<run_id>`, `docs-freshness-catchup-<run_id>`); track the
`coverage` field over time to evidence "manual doc effort < 30 min/week".

## Local dry run (no push, no PR)

```bash
export ENGINE=copilot COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat>   # or: ENGINE=claude ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Same scope the nightly computes: code changed since the last documented commit.
ANCHOR=$(git log -1 --format=%B "$(git log -1 --format=%H --grep='^Docs-sync-anchor:')" \
  | sed -n 's/^Docs-sync-anchor:[[:space:]]*//p' | tail -1)
git diff --name-only "${ANCHOR:-HEAD~20}" HEAD \
  | grep -Ev '^(Docs/|doc/|docs/|AGENTS\.md|CLAUDE\.md|\.docs-sync\.json)' > docs-scope.txt
bash tools/docs-sync/run_docs_agent.sh   # edits + stages docs
git diff --cached --stat                 # inspect
git reset --hard                         # discard if only testing
```

## Notes / gotchas

- `fetch-depth: 0` is required: the freshness metric and the `<anchor>..HEAD`
  diff need full history.
- **Two tokens, no loop.** The `COPILOT_PAT` user token authenticates the model
  call only. Pushing + opening the PR use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose
  pushes do **not** re-trigger workflows — so the doc commit can't loop. Never
  push with the PAT (a PAT push *would* re-trigger).
- **Don't strip the `Docs-sync-anchor:` trailer** when merging a docs PR (e.g. by
  hand-editing the squash message). Without it the next run silently falls back
  to a 26h window and skips whatever came before that.
- The nightly documents `master` only. Code on a long-lived feature branch is
  documented once it merges, not before.
- Repos not yet through 1.19: run the `docs-init` skill once to bootstrap, then
  add these workflows. `docs_freshness.py` refuses to run without a manifest.
- *Silent drift* a scoped diff can't see is handled by `docs-catchup.yml` (the
  weekly full sweep), not by the nightly.
