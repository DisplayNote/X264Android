# open_catchup_pr.sh — open a dedicated documentation PR. Roadmap 2.30.
#
# Used by both scheduled workflows, neither of which has a PR context. It takes
# the doc changes the agent has already staged, puts them on a fresh branch, and
# opens ONE PR against the base branch for review.
#
# Two modes (MODE env):
#   catchup  (default) - docs-catchup.yml: the one-time backfill and the weekly
#                        FULL drift sweep. The right unit for reconciling drift
#                        that accumulated before this automation existed.
#   nightly            - docs-sync.yml: the nightly sync, scoped to the code
#                        committed to the base branch since the last documented
#                        commit. Defers to ANY open docs PR (nightly or
#                        catch-up) so the two can't propose competing edits.
#
# No-op (exit 0) when the agent produced no changes.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   GH_TOKEN    - built-in GITHUB_TOKEN (push + PR). Pushing with it does not
#                 re-trigger workflows.
#   BASE        - base branch to target (default master).
#   MODE        - catchup | nightly (default catchup).
